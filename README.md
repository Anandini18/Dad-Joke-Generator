# Dad-Joke-Generator

Welcome to the Dad Joke Generator web page! This project is a simple web application that generates random dad jokes for your amusement. It utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide a user-friendly interface and fetch jokes from a remote API. Additionally, the page includes a loading button to handle API requests, and it gracefully handles scenarios like 404 errors, offline mode, and no active internet connection.

# Features
- Dad Joke Generation: Click on the "Get a Joke" button to fetch a random dad joke from the API and display it on the page. Each time you click the button, a new joke will be fetched and shown.

- Loading Button: To ensure a smooth user experience, we have implemented a loading button. When you click the "Get a Joke" button, it will change to a loading state while the joke is being fetched from the API. Once the joke is retrieved, it will display on the page.

- Error Handling: In case the API request fails due to a 404 error or if the user is offline or has no active internet connection, the web page will gracefully handle these situations and display an appropriate error message.

# Technologies Used
This project is primarily built using the following technologies:

- HTML: The structure of the web page is created using HTML to define the layout and elements.
